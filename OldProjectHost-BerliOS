Anonymous CVS Access

This project's BerliOS Developer CVS repository can be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS with the following instruction set. 
The module you wish to check out must be specified as the modulename (modules are top level directories in the repository). 
To see the list of the modules available in the repository use the web-based CVS repository access. 
When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/giant login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/giant co modulename

Updates from within the module's directory do not need the -d parameter.

Developer CVS Access via SSH

Only project developers can access the CVS tree via this method. SSH2 must be installed on your client machine. 
Substitute modulename and developername with the proper values. Enter your site password when prompted.

export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 -ddevelopername@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/giant co modulename
